#### Project Description
You are in a maze, and you have to get out. In this Deep Dark Mysterious Maze, you face
many dangers. Be warned, Oh Great Explorer, you may die.

As you travel, you may fall into mysterious swamps and unknown caves. You may encounter
magical beings and terrifying monsters. You may even come across powerful weapons never
wielded by mortals before.

Your goal is to arm yourself with weapons, fight monsters, and find your way out of this
labyrinth.

#### How to Launch
1. For the peace of mind, run `javac *.java` instead of `javac Woo.java`
2. From there, run `java Woo` and the Mysterious Maze shall be launched.
3. Type in your name and hit enter. If you don't give your name, a name will be given to you.
4. When it asks you if you want to procede, the only acceptable answers are "yes" or "no".
5. Find your own path through the maze! Use the section "How to Navigate the Maze?" section to see more info.
6. If you meet a monster, you will be asked if you want to use an item from your inventory. Acceptable answers are "yes" or "no". Keep in mind that once you use the item, the item's effects will wear off.
7. If you encounter an item, it will add to your inventory. The most recently added item will be used if you chose to use it in battle.
