#### Project Description
You are in a maze, and you have to get out. In this Deep Dark Mysterious Maze, you face
many dangers. Be warned, Oh Great Explorer, you may die.

As you travel, you may fall into mysterious swamps and unknown caves. You may encounter
magical beings and terrifying monsters. You may even come across powerful weapons never
wielded by mortals before.

Your goal is to arm yourself with weapons, fight monsters, and find your way out of this
labyrinth.

#### How to Launch
